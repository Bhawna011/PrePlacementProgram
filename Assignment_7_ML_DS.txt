To handle imbalanced datasets during model training and validation, you can employ the following techniques:

•	Resampling: Use resampling techniques such as oversampling or under sampling to balance the dataset. Oversampling increases the number of instances in the minority class, while under sampling reduces the number of instances in the majority class.

•	Data augmentation: Apply data augmentation techniques, such as adding noise, rotating, flipping, or scaling, to artificially increase the diversity of the minority class and balance the dataset.

•	Class weights: Assign class weights during model training to give higher importance to the minority class. This compensates for the class imbalance and adjusts the loss function accordingly.

•	Ensemble methods: Utilize ensemble methods like bagging or boosting that combine multiple models or training iterations to account for class imbalance. These methods can improve the performance of minority class prediction.

•	Anomaly detection: Treat the imbalanced class as an anomaly detection problem. This involves training a model to identify instances of the minority class that deviate significantly from the majority class and treating them as anomalies.

•	Evaluation metrics: Use evaluation metrics that are robust to class imbalance, such as precision, recall, F1 score, or area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC). These metrics provide a comprehensive understanding of the model's performance across different classes.

•	Stratified sampling: When splitting the dataset into training and validation sets, ensure that the class proportions are maintained in both sets. This helps in preventing a biased evaluation of the model's performance.

•	Transfer learning: Leverage pre-trained models or feature extractors trained on larger and more balanced datasets. Fine-tune these models using the imbalanced dataset, allowing the model to leverage the knowledge learned from the balanced data.

•	Data collection: If feasible, consider collecting more data for the minority class to improve its representation in the dataset and reduce class imbalance.

•	Model selection: Choose models that are less sensitive to class imbalance, such as decision trees, random forests, or support vector machines, which can handle imbalanced datasets more effectively.
